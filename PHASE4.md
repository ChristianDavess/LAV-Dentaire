 LAV Dentaire Appointment System Implementation Plan

    Overview

    Transform the current placeholder appointment system into a fully functional, 
    production-ready appointment management system that strictly adheres to shadcn/ui 
    design standards and integrates seamlessly with the existing LAV Dentaire architecture.

    Phase 1: Foundation Setup

    1. Install Missing shadcn Components
      - Add calendar and date-picker components via shadcn/ui CLI
      - Verify all required components are available

    Phase 2: API Development

    2. Build Appointment API Endpoints
      - Implement full CRUD operations in /api/appointments/route.ts
      - Add individual appointment operations in /api/appointments/[id]/route.ts
      - Create availability checking endpoint /api/appointments/availability
      - Add comprehensive validation and error handling
      - Implement conflict detection logic

    Phase 3: Core Components

    3. Create Appointment Components Directory
      - src/components/appointments/appointment-calendar.tsx - Main calendar with 
    month/week/day views
      - src/components/appointments/appointment-list.tsx - List view with filtering
      - src/components/appointments/appointment-card.tsx - Individual appointment display       
      - src/components/appointments/time-slot-picker.tsx - Time selection interface
      - src/components/appointments/appointment-status-badge.tsx - Status indicators
    4. Update Core Files
      - Replace placeholder /src/app/(dashboard)/appointments/page.tsx with full 
    appointment system
      - Enhance /src/components/forms/appointment-form.tsx with complete booking 
    functionality

    Phase 4: Integration & Logic

    5. Add Utility Functions
      - Create /src/lib/utils/appointment-utils.ts for conflict detection and time 
    validation
      - Build /src/lib/hooks/use-appointments.ts for data management
      - Implement proper TypeScript typing throughout

    Phase 5: UX & Polish

    6. User Experience Enhancements
      - Loading states with shadcn Skeleton components
      - Toast notifications for all user actions
      - Form validation with proper error messages
      - Mobile-responsive calendar interface
      - Keyboard accessibility support

    Design System Compliance

    - shadcn/ui ONLY: No custom components or external libraries

    - Icons: h-4 w-4 for navigation, h-5 w-5 for logos
    - Status Colors: Scheduled (blue), Completed (green), Cancelled (red), No-show (gray)       
    - Components: Calendar + Badge overlays, Form + DatePicker + Select + Textarea

    - Efficient data caching and pagination
    - Input sanitization and SQL injection prevention
    - Rate limiting on API endpoints

    This implementation will complete Phase 4 of the DEVELOPMENT-PLAN.md and provide a 
    professional-grade appointment scheduling system for the dental clinic.
